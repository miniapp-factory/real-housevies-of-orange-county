+A quiz that lets someone find out which Real Housewives of Orange County energy they give off on a fun personality scale by answering 5 multiple choice questions, and then allows them to share their result.
+
+Create 4 result tiers based on their score/personality type:
+
+Tier 1 – “Chill Newport Neighbor” (low drama, low glam, more laid-back)
+
+Tier 2 – “Casual Brunch Bestie” (social, fun, mild drama)
+
+Tier 3 – “Confessional Queen” (big opinions, glam, loves a storyline)
+
+Tier 4 – “Ultimate OC Housewife” (maximum glam, drama, leadership vibes)
+
+Generate a unique cute cartoon vector illustration for each result tier featuring an OC–style housewife character (no specific real person likenesses), showing increasing levels of glam/drama:
+
+Chill Newport Neighbor – simple outfit, sunglasses, coffee
+
+Casual Brunch Bestie – cute dress, mimosa, sunny patio
+
+Confessional Queen – glam dress, statement jewelry, talking pose
+
+Ultimate OC Housewife – full glam, big hair, champagne, dramatic pose
+
+Display the corresponding image, tier name, and a short description on the result page for that user. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.
+
+Place the quiz on the home page.
